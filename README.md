# Data Visualization-Analyze performance of US Hospital
* In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reports several measures indicative of hospital quality, such as outcomes, patient experience and      whether established processes of care are followed. This visualization project aims to use those metrics to analyze the overall hospital performance across United States.        Through this visualization exercise we will try to:

     * Understand hospital performance at a national level across various quality metrics
     * Understand individual hospital performance as characterized by multiple quality measures
     * Identify high performer hospitals which have great outcomes and high patient ratings vs low performers which have low outcomes and low patient ratings
